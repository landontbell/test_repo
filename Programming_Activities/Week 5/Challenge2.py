"""
2. Write a Python program to generate a multiplication table for a given number. 
Ask the user to enter a number, and then use the range() function to generate a table of multiplication
from 1 to 10 for that number. For example, if the user enters 5, the program should print:

5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
...
5 x 10 = 50
