"""
1. Write a Python program that checks the strength of a user's password. Password strength is determined by the following rules:

The password must be at least 8 characters long.
The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.
The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.
The password must contain at least one digit.
The password may contain special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $, etc.), but it is not required.
Your program should prompt the user to enter a password, and then it should determine whether the password meets these criteria.

Example Input/Output:
# Input
password = "SecureP@ssw0rd"
# Output
Password is strong!

# Input
password = "weak"
# Output
Password is weak. It does not meet the criteria.
