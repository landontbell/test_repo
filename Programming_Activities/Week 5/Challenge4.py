2. You are building a weather decision-making system for a camping trip. 
To decide whether to go camping, you need to consider the weather conditions and other factors. 
You will make the decision based on the following criteria:

The weather should be either clear or partly cloudy.
The temperature should be between 50째F (10째C) and 85째F (30째C).
It should not be raining or snowing.
It should not be too windy (wind speed less than 20 mph).
Your program should prompt the user to enter the current weather conditions, temperature, and wind speed
then determine whether it's a good day to go camping.

Write a Python program for weather-based decision-making that takes weather conditions, temperature, and wind speed as input
and checks if it's a good day for camping based on the criteria above.
Display a message indicating whether it's a good day to go campingor not.
